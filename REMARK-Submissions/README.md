# REMARK Submissions

This directory is where you should put a new REMARK that you would like
to submit for publication as part of the [econ-ark.org](https://econ-ark.org)
catalog of REMARKs.

The instructions are simple:

1. Make a "fork" of the [REMARK](https://github.com/econ-ark/REMARK) repo
   * If you already have a fork:
       * Be sure to update your fork to the upstream master before proceeding
1. Create a "branch" in your fork with the name of your REMARK
   * e.g. "CGMPortfolio" is an existing REMARK
   * Its authors would have created a branch via `git checkout -b CGMPortfolio`
1. Make a corresponding subdirectory in this directory (REMARK/REMARK-Submissions)
   * `cd REMARK-Submissions` 
   * `mkdir CGMPortfolio`
1. Make a `pull request` to merge your REMARK into the master REMARK repo
