# REMARK: Replications and Explorations Made using the ARK

The [ballpark](http://github.com/econ-ark/ballpark) contains a set of papers that we would be delighted to have replicated in the Econ-ARK. 

This REMARK repo is where we intend to store such replications (as well as the code for papers whose codebase was originally written using the Econ-ARK).

In cases where the replication's author is satisfied that the main results of the paper have been successfully replicated, we expect to approve pull requests with minimal review.

We also expect to approve with little review cases where the author has a clear explanation of discrepancies between the paper's published results and the results in the replication attempt. 

We are NOT intending this resource to be viewed as an endorsement of the replication; instead, it is a place for it to be posted publicly for other people to see and form judgments on. Nevertheless, pull requests for attempted replications that are unsuccessful for unknown reasons will require a bit more attention from the Econ-ARK staff, which may include contacting the original author(s) to see if they can explain the discrepancies, or may include consulting with experts in the particular area in question.

Replication archives should contain two kinds of content (along with explanatory material):
Code that attempts to comprehensively replicate the results of the paper, and a Jupyter notebook that presents at least a minimal set of examples of the use of the code.

This material will all be stored in a directory with some short pithy name (a bibtex citekey might make a good directory name) which, if written in an Econ-ARK compatible style, will also be the name of a module that other users can import and use.

Code archives should contain:
   * All information required to get the replication code to run
   * An indication of how long that takes on some particular machine
   
Jupyter notebook(s) should:
   * Explain their own content ("This notebook uses the associated replication archive to demonstrate three central results from the paper of [original author]: The consumption function and the distribution of wealth)
   * Be usable for someone wanting to explore the replication interactively (so, no cell should take more than a minute or two to execute on a laptop)
