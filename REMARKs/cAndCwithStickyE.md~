# cAndCwithStickyE is a Reproduction 

For authors whose computational results were constructed using the Econ-ARK toolkit, we ask that the resulting code be posted in a directory with a structure like the one for cAndCwithStickyE.

In particular, at the root level of the directory there should be three python files

* `do_min.py` does whatever is the simplest (and fastest) useful exercise that can be done with the tool
* `do_all.py` should reproduce all of the results that the archive is capable of producing

were originally written using the Econ-ARK
