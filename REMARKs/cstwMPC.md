# cstwMPC is a Replication of the results in 
## [The Distribution of Wealth and the Marginal Propensity to Consume](http://econ.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/papers/cstwMPC)

The main results in that paper were generated using the Mathematica code in 

./Code/Matheamtica 

by running the `DoAll.m` file from the command line

The results have been replicated using the HARK toolkit.

The three replication files are as follows:

### `ipython do_min.py`: 
Takes 3-5 minutes to reproduce a few results from the small open economy version of the model
without aggregate shocks

### `ipython do_mid.py`: 
Takes an hour or so to produce the main SOE verson of the model with aggregate shocks

### `ipython do_all.py`: 
In principle, should produce all results of the paper 

### `ipython do_custom.py`: 
User-customizable file to produce any particular desired version
