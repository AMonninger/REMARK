Update: The results of this paper are now generated in an updated repository using a more modern version of HARK, [DistributionOfWealth](https://github.com/econ-ark/DistributionOfWealth). Any followup work should build on the updated code in that repository.


# cstwMPC is a Replication of the results in 
## [The Distribution of Wealth and the Marginal Propensity to Consume](http://econ.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/papers/cstwMPC)
### by Christopher Carroll, Jiri Slacalek, Kiichi Tokuoka, Matthew N. White
### published in _Quantitative Economics_ in 2017

The main results in that paper were generated using the Mathematica that can be executed by running from the command line 

`./Code/Mathematica/DoAll.m`

or by opening the corresponding notebook file `./Code/Matheamtica/DoAll.nb`

The Mathematica results have been replicated using the HARK toolkit.  See the README.md file in the repo for details.
