    "# Optimal Financial Investment over the Life Cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "Economists like to compare people's actual behavior to the choices that would be made by a \"rational\" agent who understands all the complexities of a decision, and who knows how to compute the mathematically optimal choice.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The \"optimal\" choice can be computed using powerful tools that descend directly from those used originally by physicists and engineers to calculate, for example, the \"optimal\" trajectories for the Apollo spacecraft. \n",
    "\n",
    "Surprisingly, calculating how much to save for retirement, and the optimal amount of your savings to put in risky assets (like stocks), is a **much** harder problem than calculating the optimal path for landing on the moon.  In fact, only in 2005 was the first academic paper published that made such calculations in a way realistic enough to take seriously in the real world -- if by \"seriously\" we mean that economists's actual personal choices (and the advice they give to friends and family) were influenced by the results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "But even today, these tools so difficult to use that it can take years of work for a new researcher to build up the expertise needed to construct mathematically optimal solutions to problems like these.  So much work is needed because each economist (or team of coauthors) has needed to construct from scratch their own elaborate and complex body of computer code tailored to solving exactly the problem they are interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of the [Econ-ARK](https://econ-ark.org) toolkit is to address that problem by providing a set of open-source software tools that can solve many computationally difficult models of optimal consumer choice; one of the early contributions of the toolkit was a tool that calculates the optimal path of retirement saving under fairly realistic assumptions  (see below for details).  One of the reasons these conditions are only \"fairly\" relaistic, though is that the model makes the assumption that the consumer cannot invest any of those savings \"risky\" assets that are expected to earn a higher rate of return than, say, a bank account (\"safe\" assets).\n",
    "\n",
    "This blog post introduces a new tool in the toolkit, which extends the life cycle/retirement saving model to incorporates the optimal choice of portfolio share between \"risky\" and \"safe\" assets.  The development of this tool was generously funded by the Think Forward Institute."

    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Nobody saving for retirement knows exactly what the future holds. They are likely to change jobs several times during their career, and each new job will have a different profile of income growth and risk; they might develop health problems that cut short their life even before they reach retirement (in which case retirement savings would  be unnecessary, or they might turn out to be so healthy that they live to 100 (in which case there is a danger of outliving their savings).\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncertainties of these (and other) kinds are why the consumer's problem is so much harder than the astronaut's: The motion of a spacecraft is almost perfectly predictable using Newton's equations.  In a vacuum, if you set it in motion in a certain direction and with a certain velocity, those equations let you calculate to within a matter of inches where it will be weeks in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way economists calculate \"optimal\" behavior in over the lifetime begins with an attempt to quantify each of the risks. For example, from available datasets we can calculate how often people change jobs at each age of life, taking account of personal characteristics like education, occupation and so on, and on what happens to their income after job changes.  Job-related income uncertainty can thus be represented mathematically as a statistical distribution over the many possible future outcomes, and similarly for other kinds of risk (like health risk). When all the individual risks have been quantified, we can calculate the joint probabilities of every conceivable draw of the risks, and weight each possible outcome by its probability.  Finally, we can calculate how the outcomes (like, for retirement income) depend on the choice of saving and portfolio choice, and determine which choices would are the best ones for consumers with different preferences (toward risk, for example).\n"

    "## The Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Replicating the Standard Model\n",
    "Our first step has been to reproduce the results of the above-mentioned 2005 paper (by Cocco, Gomes, and Maenhout) using our new tool.  Although our results are different in some minor respects from theirs (likely having to do with different assumptions about the details of the risks), we are able to replicate their main \"big-picture\" findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key input to such models is a measure of the degree of consumers' [\"risk aversion\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_aversion).  Roughly speaking, your degree of risk aversion determines how much you are willing to pay to buy insurance against financial risks; or, if insurance is not available, how much you alter your behavior (for example, by saving more) as a precaution against the risk.  Much consumer behavior is consistent with values of the \"relative risk aversion parameter\" in the range from 2 to 4.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The most striking conclusion of their paper was that when consumers are assumed to have a conventional degree of risk aversion, everyone at every age will want to invest all of their savings in the stock market (!):  The figure below shows the optimal risky share -- that is, the proportion of your savings invested in the risky asset -- by age, and the fact that it is stuck at 1.0 at every age means that 100 percent of your portfolio is invested in stocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The attractive thing about constructing a formal model of this kind is that it is possible to dig into it and determine out why it produces the results it does.\n",

    "Of course, the optimal portfolio share to put in the risky asset depends on your perception of the degree of riskiness and the average extra return you expect stocks will yield over the long run (the \"equity premium\").\n",
    "\n",
    "The model follows economists' conventional approach, which is to assume that the long-run equity premium and the degree of stock market riskiness will be similar in the future to their values in the past.  Specifically, an equity premium of 4 percent is a good estimate of what the average premium has typically been on stock market investments in the developed world over the past century.\n",
    "\n",
    "For values of risk aversion that describe people's behavior well in other contexts (here, we choose a value of 3), an equity premium of 4 percent a year is more than enough to compensate any rational agent for bearing the risk associated with that return."

    "## Maybe Risk Aversion is Much Greater than 3?\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters like \"relative risk aversion\" are somewhat slippery things to measure and calibrate.  Maybe the conventional choice of 3, which works well in other contexts, is for some reason inappropriate here -- maybe people just hate stock market risk much more than they hate other kinds of risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next figure shows the profile of the mean risky share when risk aversion is 6, twice the conventional value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the model says that until about age 35, it is still optimal to invest all of your savings in the stock market.  After that, the risky share declines gradually until it stabilizes at around 65 percent at age 65.\n",
    "\n",
    "These results reflect two aspects of the model\n",
    "1. Young people are assumed to start with little or no assets\n",
    "   * Their income comes mostly from working in the labor market\n",
    "   * If you have only a small amount of wealth, the absolute dollar size of the risk you are taking by investing in the risky asset is small, so the higher returns more than make up for the (small) risk\n",
    "1. By the age of retirement, you plan to finance a lot of your spending from your savings\n",
    "   * Investing everything in the stock market (like a young person) would put a large proportion of your retirement spending at risk from the fluctuations in the market\n",
    "   * The \"equity premium\" is nevertheless large enough to make it worthwhile to keep about half of your assets in stocks\n",

    "### Comparison to Professional Advice"

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Another interesting comparison is to the advice of professional investment advisors.  Though that advice can be quite sophistcated and nuanced, it is also sometimes codified in simple rules of thumb.  One of the most common of these is the \"100-age\" rule, which says that the percentage of your portfolio in risky assets should be equal to 100 minus your age, so that a 25 year old would have 75 percent in stocks while a 60 year old would have 40 percent in stocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For people before retirement, at least the shape of the profile that advisors recommend is somewhat like the shape that comes out of the model.  While the rule would say that the 25 year old should put 75 percent of their savings in the stock market and the model says 100 percent, they agree that the proportion should be high, and also agree that the proportion should decline during your working life.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the rule and the model disagree about what should happen after retirement.  The rule recommends steadily reducing your exposure to risky assets as you get older, while the model says that your exposure should remain at about the same level it was at late in your working life.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advisors, who have daily contact with real human beings, probably have an insight that the model does not incorporate:  Risk aversion may increase as you get older.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Risk aversion is remarkably difficult to measure, and economists' efforts to determine whether it increases with age have been inconclusive, with some papers finding [evidence for an increase](https://voxeu.org/article/effect-age-willingness-take-risks) (at least during working life) and others finding [little increase](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.rfe.2003.09.010). It is plausible, though, that investment advisors have insight that is hard to extract from statistical patterns but easy to perceive in interactions between live human beings.  (New research suggests that any increases in risk aversion among older people reflect [cognitive decline](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13822) associated with reduced ability to process information).\n",
    "\n",
    "For technical reasons, it is somewhat difficult to incorporate values of risk aversion that vary directly with age.  But your willingness to invest in risky assets depends on both your degree of aversion to risk and your perception of the size of the risk.  So a backdoor way to examine the consequences of risng risk aversion with age is to assume that the perceived riskiness of stock investments goes up with age.  \n",

For example, after the CGM paper was published, better estimates [became available](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmoneco.2010.04.003) about the degree and types of income uncertainty that consumers face at different ages.  The most important finding was that the degree of uncertainty in earnings is quite large for people in their 20s but falls sharply and flattens out at older ages.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It seems plausible that this greater uncertainty in labor earnings could account for the fact that in empirical data young people have a low share of their portfolio invested in risky assets; economic theory says that an increase in labor income risk should [reduce your willingness to expose yourself to financial risk](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2951719).\n",
