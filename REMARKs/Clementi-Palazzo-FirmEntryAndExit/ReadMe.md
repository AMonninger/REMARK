Welcome to this folder containing python codes for replication of Khan-Thomas (2008) and Clementi-Palazzo (2016).
There are three jupyter  notebooks here: Firm_Final, Firm Entry and Exit (Clementi-Palazzo AEJ 2016), Firm Heterogeneity (Khan-Thomas-Winberry), Entry_Exit. The first three files are sufficient for our purpose. There are some additional Matlab files that I created for doing some aggregate shocks replication and I will upload them in due course.
The logic of coding is in a pdf document and it entails step by step solving of what I have done.
In terms of requirements, I have had to rely on quantecon's Tauchen machinery, therefore, a pip install quantecon is very much needed for the jupyter notebooks to run.
Finally, I have a demo paper with slides located under the Tex Folder.
Thank you!
